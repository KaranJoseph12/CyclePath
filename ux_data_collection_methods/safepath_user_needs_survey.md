# Survey Questions:
SafePath User Needs Survey
Smarter, Safer Journeys for Cyclists and Pedestrians
Thank you for taking part in this survey!
We’re designing SafePath, an innovative app that helps people discover safer walking and cycling routes across urban environments.
Our mission is simple: to help users travel confidently by reducing risks such as low lighting, crime hotspots, blocked lanes, and unsafe road conditions.
Unlike standard navigation apps that focus only on the fastest route, SafePath intelligently blends safety, comfort, and community awareness using open data and user-reported insights.
Your input will directly shape how we design SafePath. helping us understand what real users need most.
Estimated time to complete: 5–7 minutes.
