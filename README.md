**💡 About SafePath**

With **SafePath**, you can **discover safer walking and cycling routes** across urban environments.  
Our mission is simple: **help users travel confidently** by reducing risks like low lighting, crime hotspots, blocked lanes, and unsafe road conditions.

Unlike standard navigation apps that focus only on the _fastest route_, SafePath intelligently blends **safety, comfort, and community awareness** using open data and user-reported insights.

"SafePath helps you choose the _smartest way home - not just the fastest._"

**👥 Who Is It For**

SafePath is designed for:

- 🚴 **Cyclists** - from beginners to daily commuters seeking safer, well-lit, and bike-friendly routes.
- 🚶 **Pedestrians** - students, workers, or evening walkers who want to feel secure and informed about their surroundings.
- 🏙️ **City planners and councils** - to visualize community safety data and improve active-travel infrastructure.

SafePath helps users:

- Avoid unsafe or poorly lit areas.
- Find secure bike parking spots.
- Receive live alerts about hazards, weather, or blocked lanes.
- Share anonymous reports to improve city safety for everyone.

**🌟 Key Features**

✅ **Safe vs. Fast Route Options** - Choose between fastest, safest, or balanced routes.  
✅ **Smart Safety Scoring** - Machine learning model evaluates lighting, traffic, and crime data.  
✅ **Community Reports** - Users flag hazards, potholes, and unsafe zones in real time.  
✅ **Weather & Lighting Alerts** - Stay informed about visibility and bad weather.  
✅ **Secure Parking Finder** - Locate nearby cycle racks and safe resting points.  
✅ **Gamification Mode** _(coming soon)_ - Earn badges for safe, eco-friendly travel.  
✅ **Offline Data** _(planned)_ - Access routes and safety data even without network coverage.

**🌍 Why It Matters**

Urban cycling and walking are key to **sustainable mobility** - but safety concerns stop many from choosing these eco-friendly options.  
SafePath supports **Dublin's Vision Zero** and **Climate Action goals** by making active travel safer and more attractive through technology.

"We don't just map roads - we map _confidence_."
