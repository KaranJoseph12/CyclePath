# cyclistPath 🚲🚶‍♀️
*A Safer Routing System for Cyclists & Pedestrians*
---

## 📌 Overview
SafeCycleRoute is a web-based application that helps cyclists and pedestrians find the safest possible routes — not just the fastest.  
It combines open data, user feedback, and machine learning to generate optimized paths that minimize risks such as poorly lit streets, crime hotspots, and hazardous road conditions.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Urban commuters often face safety risks when navigating unfamiliar areas — from crime hotspots to unlit streets and road hazards.  
Current navigation apps optimize for speed, not safety. **SafeCycleRoute** addresses this by prioritizing safer travel.

---

## 👥 Target Users
- Commuters in unfamiliar areas  
- Women traveling alone at night  
- Elderly pedestrians  
- Recreational cyclists  
- Delivery workers & rideshare drivers  
- Urban planners & transport authorities  

---

## 🛡️ Safety Factors Considered
- 🌧️ Bad weather (rain, wind, ice)  
- 🚨 Crime hotspots  
- 💡 Low lighting  
- 🚶‍♀️🚲 No footpaths or cycle lanes  
- 🚧 Hazards & roadworks  
- 🚗 Busy high-traffic roads  

---

## 📖 Example Use Case
A TU Dublin student needs to walk from **Grangegorman Campus** to **Parnell Luas stop** in the evening:

- **Fastest Route 🔴** → 10 minutes, but through unsafe, poorly lit streets.  
- **Safest Route 🟢** → 12 minutes, along better lit streets with higher pedestrian activity.  
- During the walk, the app detects **roadworks near Bolton Street** and reroutes the student safely.  
- The student reports a broken streetlight, improving future data for all users.  

---

## 🏗️ MVP Scope
- Web app focused on **Manhattan**  
- Input: origin-destination → 3 route options (Fastest, Safest, Balanced)  
- Basic safety scoring (NYPD crime data + open datasets)  
- User hazard reporting and feedback collection  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend**  
- React.js  

**Backend**  


**Routing Engine & ML**  


**Data Sources**  
- NYPD Crime API  
- OpenStreetMap (OSM)  
- NYC Open Data  
- User-submitted hazard reports  
- Weather APIs  

---

## 📅 Development Plan (SCRUM)
- **Sprint 1-2** → Data pipeline & routing  
- **Sprint 3-4** → Safety scoring & frontend integration  
- **Sprint 5-6** → Validation & optimization  

**Project Management Tool:** Jira (sprint boards & backlog tracking)  

---

## 📊 Evaluation Plan
**Quantitative:**  
- Historical validation  
- Algorithm performance testing  
- Safety score validation  

**Qualitative:**  
- Expert feedback  
- Literature comparison  
- Case study analysis  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Expand to Brooklyn & other boroughs  
- Add more safety factors (lighting, weather, bike lanes)  
- Partner with transport authorities  
- Scale to other global cities
